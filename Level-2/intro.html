    <h1 id="intro">Decision Time!</h1>
    <p id="description">Decision statements are like your helpful friend who tells you what to do.</p>
    <p id="description">Decision statements are like magical helpers that can make things happen based on certain conditions. They help us choose between different options, just like when you decide whether to eat apples or bananas with your magic wand. So, decision statements are super important because they help us make fun choices and do cool things!</p>
    <p id="description">Have you ever had to choose between two things? Let's play a fun game:</p>
    <p id="description">Imagine you have a magic wand that can turn things into either apples or bananas!</p>
    <p id="description">If I feel a little happy, I will eat apples. But if I am very, very happy, then I will eat bananas.</p>
    <p id="des2">Pseudocode for the task above:</p>
    <pre>
        IF (happy) THEN:
            OUTPUT "Apples"
        ELSE IF (extremely happy) THEN:
            OUTPUT "bananas"
        ENDIF
    </pre>
    <p id="des2">In Python code, we would write:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            print("How are you feeling right now?\n")
            print("Choose: 1. a little happy 2. very, very happy\n")
            mood = input()
            if mood == 'a little happy':
                print("Let's have yummy apples!")
            elif mood == 'very, very happy':
                print("Yay! It's time for delicious bananas!")
            else:
                print("Hmm... I'm not sure what to do with that feeling!")
        </code>
