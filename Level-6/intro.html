    <h1 id="intro">Search  Expedition</h1>

    <p id="description">
        Lets learn about an algorithm called Linear Search. Linear search is a searching algorithm
        that search for a specific value given a list or an array. It is like someone search for something 
        in their house. they go to specific location.
    </p>

    <h3 id="des2">How does the algorithm work?</h3>
    <p id="description">
        lets say that we have a list ["keys", "wallet", "phone", "pen", "handkerchief"]. Each element in the list or array 
        has an index. eg, at index 0, we have "keys". 
    </p>

    <p id="description">
        lets search for phone. <br>
        lets key a count of the index. lets start at the first index, 0. At index 0, is keys. Is keys a phone? NO! 
        We increment the Index. Index = 1. <br>
        At index 1. is wallet. Is wallet a phone? NO! Again increment Index = 2. <br>
        At index 2, is phone. Is phone a phone? YES! WE found it. the we display that phone was found at index 2.
    </p>

    <h3 id="des2">Here is the code in Psuedocode and Python</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>


            # Psuedocode
            list = ["keys", "wallet", "phone", "pen", "handkerchief"]
            FUNCTION LinearSearch(list:ARRAY, SearchItem: STRING) RETURNS INTEGER
            DECLARE index = 0
                WHILE (index <= LENGTH(list))
                    IF list[index] == SearchItem THEN
                        OUTPUT "The search item is at: " index
                        RETURN index
                    ELSE
                        index = index + 1
                    ENDIF
                RETURN -1 // Return -1 if value is not found.
