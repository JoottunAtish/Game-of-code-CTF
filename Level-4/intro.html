    <h1>Let's Talk About Functions!</h1>
    <p>Functions in programming are like special tools that help us organize our code and perform specific tasks.</p>
    <p>Imagine you have a magical toolbox that contains different functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Function 1:</strong> Turns numbers into colors</li>
        <li><strong>Function 2:</strong> Makes shapes dance on the screen</li>
        <li><strong>Function 3:</strong> Counts how many stars are in the sky</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each function has a unique job, just like how each tool in your magical toolbox helps you with different tasks.</p>
    <p>Let's create a magical function together:</p>
    <p>Function to add two numbers:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
                return num1 + num2;
            }
            let result = addNumbers(5, 3);
            console.log("The sum is: " + result);
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>With functions, we can reuse code, make our programs more organized, and perform complex tasks with ease!</p>
    <h2>Types of Functions</h2>
    <p>There are different types of functions like built-in functions, user-defined functions, recursive functions, and more, each serving a specific purpose in programming.</p>
