    <h1>Iteration and Looping</h1>
    <p>Iteration statements are like your friendly guide that helps you repeat tasks.</p>
    <p>Loops are like magical spells that can make things happen repeatedly based on certain conditions. They help us
        perform tasks multiple times, just like when you keep turning objects into apples or bananas with your magic
        wand. So, loops are super important because they help us automate tasks and do cool things over and over!</p>
    <p>Have you ever needed to do something repeatedly? Let's explore the power of loops:</p>
    <p>Imagine you have a magic wand that can transform items into apples or bananas repeatedly!</p>
    <p>If I feel a little happy, I will eat apples. But if I am very, very happy, then I will eat bananas.</p>
    <p>Pseudocode for the task above using loops:</p>
    <pre>
        FOR i <-- 1 to 5:
            OUTPUT i
        ENDFOR
    </pre>

    <p>
        in the code above, the i is a variable that is incremented each time output is done. it stops when the
        value becomes 5. so it will display (1,2,3,4,5)
    </p>

    <p>In Python code with loops, we would write:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            for i in range(5):
                print(i)
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>Looping Structures</h2>
    <p>There are different types of loops like the FOR loop(Count control), WHILE loop(Pre-conditional looping),
        and DO-WHILE loop(Post-conditional Looping) that help us repeat tasks efficiently.</p>

    <li>
        <ul>FOR LOOP -- Count Control Looping</ul>
        <ul>WHILE LOOP -- Pre Conditional Looping</ul>
        <ul>REPEAT LOOP or DO-WHILE LOOP -- Post Conditional Looping</ul>
    </li>
