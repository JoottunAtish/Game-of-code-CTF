    <h1>Intro to coding!</h1>
    <p>
        In this journey to learn to code, we will teach you how to where to start and how to code.
        We will start with the fundamental like Psuedocode and teach you a programming language called
        python. Additionally we will also teach you the basics of logic.
    </p>

    <h3>difference between Psuedocode and a programming language</h3>
    <p>
        Psuedocode is not a programming language, rather it is used in the design process to show how the code 
        will look and if the logic is correct. it is written in paper. Then if the logic of program is correct, 
        we can then transfer to a programming language like python.
        <br>
        python is a high level programming language, meaning the program is closer to the english language. Python 
        is also case-sensitive. Meaning, `Print` and `print` are different.
    </p>

    <h2>Lets get started then!</h2>

    <h3>Display of messages</h3>
    <p>
        Why do we need to make display? It is simple. It is to provide feedback to the user. Example, lets say
        you are downloading a game or a program, it shows you a progress bar and how much of the program has been 
        downloaded. It gives you a visual respond and it interacts with the user.
    </p>

    <h3>Lets make the progrm to display 'Hello, world!!'</h3>

    <pre>
        <code>
            Psuedocode:
                OUTPUT "Hello, world!!"

            Python:
                print("Hello, world!!")
        </code>
    </pre>


    <h3>Data types</h3>
    <p>
        In coding, numbers and alphabets are represented differently. The way they are called are:
    </p>
    <table border="1px">
        <heading>
            <th>Values</th>
            <th>Datatype</th>
        </heading>
        <tr>
            <td>1234</td>
            <td>INTEGER</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>"ABC, abc"</td>
            <td>STRING</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>TRUE, FALSE </td>
            <td>BOOLEAN</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1.43 or -0.4</td>
            <td>FLOAT / DECIMAL</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Note: Numbers can also be strings</p>

    <h3>Declaration of variables</h3>
    <p>
        Variables are like storage boxes. They store data. they store any value that we define it to.
        If we define a variable of data type integer, it will only store values like numbers(1,4,5,-4.65)
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            // Declaration in Psuedocode 
            DECLARE ~variable name~: ~data Type~
            DECLARE Num : INTEGER
            DECLARE World: STRING
            DECLARE is_True: BOOLEAN

            # In python to declare a value you just initialise it with the value you want.
            number = 34
            word = "This is a string of word."
            is_True = True
        </code>
    </pre>
