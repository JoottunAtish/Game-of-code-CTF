    <h1>Arrays!</h1>
    <p>Arrays are like magical bags that can hold multiple items at once.</p>
    <p>They allow us to store a collection of items, like a bag of apples or a bunch of bananas, in a single variable.</p>
    <p>Have you ever needed to keep track of many things at once? Let's explore the power of arrays:</p>
    <p>Imagine you have a bag that can hold different fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges!</p>
    <p>Here's a simple example using arrays:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            # Creating an array of fruits
            fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges"]

            # Accessing elements in the array
            print("My favorite fruit is " + fruits[0])

        </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>Array Operations</h2>
    <p>Arrays support various operations like adding elements, removing elements, and accessing specific elements by their index.</p>
